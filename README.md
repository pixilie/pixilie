Hi 👋, I'm Kristen, an 19-year-old French student.

I have always been interested in programming and love creating my projects. I started with Python a few years ago, but my first real project was a weather app. After that, I delved into web development and, more recently, I've been working on Discord bots. My next goal is to learn lower-level languages such as Rust and C and start software development.

You can contact me by [mail](mailto:contact@pixilie.net) 📫 or with discord (`@pixilie`) 🗨️.
